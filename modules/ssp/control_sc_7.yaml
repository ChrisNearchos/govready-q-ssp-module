      ## SC-7 Boundary Protection

      From the NIST SP 800-53

      > The information system:

      > a. Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system;
      >
      > b. Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection: physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and

      > c. Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture.

        The {{project}} information system:

        a.  Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system with {{project.system_basics_technical.cloud_provider.text}} Security Groups that function as firewalls and actively monitor and control all communication interfaces to the internet and between defined internal system partitions.

        b.  Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are logically separated from internal organizational networks by configuring different security groups to establish logically separated subnetworks; and

        c.  Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture by using {{project.system_basics_technical.cloud_provider.text}} Security Groups which are required in {{project.system_basics_technical.cloud_provider.text}} to connect to external networks (e.g., Internet) and other information systems.
