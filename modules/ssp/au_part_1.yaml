    title: Types of audited events
    type: interstitial
    prompt: |
      [{{organization}} policies](https://www2.ed.gov/fund/contract/about/acs/acshbocio01.pdf) define information system auditable events by to include:

      * Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g. classification levels),
      * Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts,
      * Privileged activities or other system level access,
      * Starting and ending time for user access to the system, 
      * Concurrent logons from different workstations
      * Successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects,
      * All program initiations, 
      * All direct access to the information system, 
      * All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations,
      * All kernel module load, unload, and restart

      Let&rsquo;s take these one by one for **{{project}}**.

  - id: audit_modify_privileges_os_level
    title: Modify privileges at operating system level
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit all successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels at the level of the operating system?

      This includes events like changing security permissions of an operating system-level user account, or a file directory permissions, or what is being audited by the operating system.

  - id: audit_modify_privileges_application_level
    title: Modify privileges at application level
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit all successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels at the level of the various applications composing **{{project}}**?

      We are trying to make sure changes to security settings within applications (example: who becomes an admin) and access settings to application data are tracked. 
      
  - id: audit_logon_attempts 
    title: Logon attempts
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit successful and unsuccessful login attempts at both the operating system level and the application level?

  - id: audit_privileged_activities_os_level 
    title: Privileged activities
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit those extra special, operating system level administration activities like creating and removing system accounts and copyring and deleting files?
  
  - id: audit_privileged_activities_application_level 
    title: Privileged activities
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit those extra special, privileged activities like creating and removing accounts and deleting information that normal users of **{{project}}** would not be able to do?

  - id: audit_user_access_startstop
    title: User access start &amp; stop 
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit when system admininstrators start and stops being logged into the operating system level and application users and admininstrators start and stop being logged in to application level?
  
  - id: audit_concurrent_user_logons
    title: Concurrent user logons
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit when the same user logons at the same time from two different workstations or devices?
  
  - id: audit_object_access
    title: Objects access
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit who is accessing key application objects like data records or privileged pages?
  
  - id: audit_program_startups
    title: Program startups
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit each time the software programs composing the system startup?
  
  - id: audit_direct_admin_access_to_host
    title: Direct admin access to host
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit when system administrators directly log into the host computers (or host administration dashboards)?
  
  - id: audit_account_changes
    title: Account changes
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit changes to operating system level user accounts and application level user accounts (e.g., create account, modify important account parameter, delete account)?
  
  - id: audit_kernel_module_loading_activities
    title: Kernel module loading activities  
    type: yesno
    prompt: |
      Does **{{project}}** currently audit any time operating system kernel module is loaded into the kernal, unloaded, and/or restarted?

        The {{project}} information system:

        a.  Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key internal boundaries within the system with }}project.system_basics.cloud_provider.text}} Security Groups that function as firewalls and actively monitor and control all communication interfaces to the internet and between defined internal system partitions.

        b.  Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are logically separated from internal organizational networks by configuring different security groups to establish logically separated subnetworks; and

        c.  Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture by using }}project.system_basics.cloud_provider.text}} Security Groups which are required in }}project.system_basics.cloud_provider.text}} to connect to external networks (e.g., Internet) and other information systems.
