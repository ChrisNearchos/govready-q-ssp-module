    ## Privacy Impact Analysis

    In todayâ€™s digital world, effective privacy for individuals depends on the safeguards
    employed within the information systems that are processing, storing, and transmitting
    Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and the environments in which those systems
    operate. Organizations cannot have effective privacy without a basic foundation of
    information security. 

    We'll walk you through a Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA). When you are finished with the
    PIA, you will have a shopping list of documents that you need to file away and a set
    of security controls that your system must implement.

    Are you ready?
